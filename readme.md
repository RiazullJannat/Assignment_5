## Functionalities

  - Clicking the "Donation" button will hide the history and display the donation data. X
- **Donation Functionality for Each Card**:

    - The donation input will be deducted from the total account balance, and the updated balance will be shown. X
    - The cardâ€™s current donation amount will increase. X
    - A meaningful notification will be added to the History section. X
- **Input Validation**:
  - Show an alert if invalid data is found and stop the transaction. X
  - Validate the donation amount:
    - If the donation amount is greater than the account balance. X
    - If the input field contains an invalid number. X
    - If the input field is empty. X
- **History Section**:
  - The history section will display transaction notifications, including:
    - Date and time of the transaction. X
    - Donation amount. X
    - Donation name. X

## Challenges

- **Sticky Navbar**: Make the navbar sticky to the top of the page. X

    1. What is the Document Object Model (DOM)? X 
    2. How do you select an element from the DOM? X
    3. What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it useful? X
    4. How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM? X
- **Toggle Active Status**: Toggle the active status of the "Donation" and "History" buttons:
  - Change the button color to indicate when it's active. X
- **Static Modal**: Display a static modal instead of an alert on a successful donation. X
- **Reusable Functions**: Use at least 2 common functions. X
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is responsive for different screen sizes. X
